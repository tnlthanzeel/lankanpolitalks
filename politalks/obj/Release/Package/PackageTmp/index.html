                        The simple man from a rural background seemed like an unlikely candidate to end the 10-year-rule of the popular Mahinda Rajapaksa who he defeated in the presidential race. Sirisena’s rise from a low-profile minister to that of the president came as a surprise to many in Sri Lankan politics. He is indeed an unassuming man who does not speak English and is always seen wearing the national dress, but he undoubtedly is a man of great character and integrity.

                    <h1>Ranil Wickremasinghe </h1>
                    <p>Ranil Wickremesinghe is the current Prime Minister of Sri Lanka. Born in a politically influential Buddhist Sinhalese family, he joined politics while he was still a university student. Although he is a lawyer by profession, he has devoted his life to politics from the very start and received his first ministerial post at the age of 28. His capabilities impressed many leaders and within a short span of time, he was made a full cabinet minister.</p>
                    <p>During his initial stints as the Prime Minister of Sri Lanka, he had to tackle insurgency led by Liberation Tigers of Tamil Elam. However, he tried to find a solution to the ethnic problem through peace talks rather than by use of brute force. This was not appreciated by majority Sinhalese population and consequently, he was forced to sit in the opposition for more than a decade. On returning to power in 2015, he took up number of development projects and also tried to repair the country’s relation with international community. In fact, economic prosperity of the nation has always been the goal of his government.</p>
